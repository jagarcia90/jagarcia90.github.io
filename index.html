			My name is Jorge Garcia, I am corrently taking a full stack development course at the UC Davis Extension Center. Before starting this class, I had always had an interest in technology but I never took structure course.  
		</p>

			Almost everything we do today whether it's communicating with friends and family, doing a presentation at work, or even getting a ride home after a long night involves some sort of technology. Being able to understand the frameworks and all of the technical aspects is a great skill to have for any industry.
			Eventually, one of the things I want to accomplish is go into to technology consulting space. One of my biggest motivations for this is in order to work remotely in order to have the time to travel to different places. Being your own boss is one of my biggest dreams, so now I have to put in the work to make it happen!
